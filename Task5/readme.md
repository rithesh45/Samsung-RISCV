# **Three Bit Calculator**
---
## Overview
This project involves the implementation of a calculator that performs Addition, Subtraction, OR, and AND operations using the VSDSquadron Mini, a RISC-V-based SoC development kit. This project showcases the practical application of digital logic, GPIO operations, and RISC-V programming. Push-button switches are used to input binary data and select operations, and the results are displayed using LEDs.

## Components Required
- VSDSquadron Mini Board: RISC-V-based development kit.
- Push Buttons (7):
3 for binary inputs of A (A2, A1, A0).
3 for binary inputs of B (B2, B1, B0).
1 for operation selection.
- 5 LEDs:
3 for the Result (Sum/Difference/OR/AND for bits R2, R1, R0).
2 for Carry/Borrow (C2, C1).
- Resistors (330Î©): To protect LEDs.
- Breadboard: For easy prototyping.
- Jumper Wires: For circuit connections.
- VS Code with PlatformIO: For writing and uploading code.
